# Video Link Manager
Have online class or working from home? Keep information about your Zoom meetings in one place.

The manager saves you the inconvenience of digging through your email or notes to find Zoom links or meeting ids.

## Getting Started
Compile and run `setup.cpp` to begin. It will ask you some questions about your schedule and will make you a custom webpage that will house your meetings' descriptions, times, and locations. After it's finished, open `index.html` in your browser and add it to your bookmarks!
