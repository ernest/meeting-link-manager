## Getting Started

    ```bash

    ```

2. Answer the questions about your schedule.

    If you enter something incorrectly, you must restart `setup.cpp` (stop with <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>).

3. A custom webpage at `index.html` will be generated that will house your meetings' descriptions, times, and locations. Open it in your browser and add it to your bookmarks!
